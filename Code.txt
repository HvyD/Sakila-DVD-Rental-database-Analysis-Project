Question 1: We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out


/*Query 1/*
SELECT f.title, c.name, COUNT(r.rental_id)
 FROM film_category fc
  JOIN category c
  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
  JOIN film f
  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
  JOIN inventory i
  ON i.film_id = f.film_id
  JOIN rental r 
  ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2, 1


Question 2 : What is the average rental duration of the movies by their genre.

/*Query 2/*
SELECT c.name as genre, ROUND(AVG(f.rental_duration),1) as avg_duration     
 FROM film f
  JOIN film_category fc
  ON f.film_id=fc.film_id
  JOIN category c
  ON c.category_id=fc.category_id
  JOIN inventory i
  ON f.film_id=i.film_id
  JOIN rental r
  ON i.inventory_id=r.inventory_id
GROUP BY 1


Question 3: Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each 
corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

a. Category
b. Rental length category
c. Count

/*Query 3/*
SELECT t1.name, t1.standard_quartile, COUNT(t1.standard_quartile)
 FROM
    (SELECT f.title, c.name , f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
 FROM film_category fc
  JOIN category c
  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
  JOIN film f
  ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')) t1 
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2


Question 4: We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a 
query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?


/*Query 4/*
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) pay_month, c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name, COUNT(p.amount) AS pay_countpermon, SUM(p.amount) AS pay_amount
 FROM customer c
  JOIN payment p
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name IN
 (SELECT t1.full_name
   FROM
 (SELECT c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name, SUM(p.amount) as amount_total
   FROM customer c
    JOIN payment p
     ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
  GROUP BY 1	
  ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10) t1) AND (p.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2008-01-01')
GROUP BY 2, 1
ORDER BY 2, 1, 3
